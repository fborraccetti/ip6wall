	# tcp_inbound chain
        #
        # This chain is used to allow inbound connections to the
        # system/gateway.  Use with care.  It defaults to none.
        # It's applied on INPUT from the external or Internet interface.


        # DNS Server - Allow TCP connections (zone transfers and large requests)
        # This is disabled by default.  DNS Zone transfers occur via TCP.
        # If you need to allow transfers over the net you need to uncomment this line.
        # If you allow queries from the 'net, you also need to be aware that although
        # DNS queries use UDP by default, a truncated UDP query can legally be
        # submitted via TCP instead.  You probably will never need it, but should
        # be aware of the fact.
