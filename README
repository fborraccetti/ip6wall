Ip6wall installation Notes
--------------------------

# ------------------------------ #
# Netfilter/iptables             #       
# -------------------------------#

Ip6wall assumes you have a properly working and
configured netfilter/iptables setup. It does not make
use of any "special" extensions or patches, but some
things will not work well unless you are sure they
are installed (such as the FTP support).

There are case where Ip6wall allows you to make
use of some of the experimental ip6tables patches,
but these are not necessary for the default settings. 

Ip6wall DOES NOT attempt to load ip6tables modules for you;
a properly configured linux system will load modules 
"as needed".

# Installing                     #             
# -------------------------------#   

The default configuration assumes everything will
be installed in /etc/ip6wall.  

Run install.sh if need a standard installation or
untar to ip6wall-<version> which means you 
will need to a) move/rename this directory to /etc/ip6wall
or b) symlink /etc/ip6wall to ip6wall-<version>/

I recommend installing/configuring the first time locally in case
something horrible happens-- otherwise, if you make a mistake, you
will find yourself locked out of your own machine.  I'm not
kidding.

* NEXT *

Open a terminal. Get out that favorite editor of yours. Edit 
ip6wall.conf -- it's commented.

* NEXT *

Read the README. It's in the docs directory. 

* NEXT *

Run the script ( /etc/init.d/ip6wall start ) <- assuming you've a debian based system 

I suggest linking this, or setting it up as an automatic process.

Three examples on how to do this. 

PPP -- under Debian, there's a nice directory -> /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/

* That's it *
