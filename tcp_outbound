# tcp_outbound chain
        #
        # This chain is used with a private network to prevent forwarding for
        # requests on specific protocols.  Applied to the FORWARD rule from
        # the internal network.  Ends with an ACCEPT

        #echo -n "Rules to manage TCP traffic ..."
        # No match, so ACCEPT
        #echo "Rules to Accept TCP traffic"
        $IPT -A tcp_outbound -p TCP -s 0/0 -j ACCEPT
        #echo done
