	# udp_outbound chain
        #
        # This chain is used with a private network to prevent forwarding for
        # UDP requests on specific protocols.  Applied to the FORWARD rule from
        # the internal network.  Ends with an ACCEPT


        # No match, so ACCEPT
        #echo -n "Rules to Accept UDP traffic"
        $IPT -A udp_outbound -p UDP -s 0/0 -j ACCEPT
        #echo done
